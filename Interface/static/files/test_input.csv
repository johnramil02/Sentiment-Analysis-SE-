2 items went missing 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
Malaki ang size kakainis😡
This is my third time ordering from the same shop. So far the service is good but this time the one I received was not the variation I ordered. I order r20 but on the packaging is r20
Lahat ng dineliver alang nagamit?
Right packaging for the wrong item it is R40 not R20. It has good sound quality yet disappointed for the wrong item. It was shipped immediately yet still disappointed for the wrong item. The seller is responsive yet still disappointed with the wrong item.
Maganda naman yung ibang item ang probem lang yung isa may sira agad siya. Putol yung isang end tas di gumagana walang audio.
There's one with right piece in one can i get a replacement to R40?
"Both earphones are not working. Sent messages to the seller but are only being ignored. Packaging also states ""built-in magnets"" for the earbuds where in fact, they are not."
"sa mga magbabalak pang bumili, WAG NA :)) dahil lang sa curiosity q bumili aq neto pero di nagana, ansaki sa puso char pero expected naman dahil sa price hehe !! so WAG PO BUMILI NETO >:"
Walang built in magnet guys! HAHAHAHAHAHA tyaka ibang iba sa itsura sa picture.
